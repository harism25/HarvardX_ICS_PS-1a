# Problem Set 1a
 
Creating and modifying a program called 'Mario' in such a way that it prompts the user for a pyramid’s height,
storing their input in a variable, re-prompting the user again and again as needed if their input is not a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive.

Then, printing the value of that variable, thereby confirming that the user’s input is stored successfully.
Once the program is accepting input, building a left-aligned pyramid first and then, once that’s working, right-aligning it instead
by pushing its hashes to the right by prefixing them with dots (i.e., periods).

The result should be looking something like below.
